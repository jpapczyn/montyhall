Description:
  The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
  Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant
  to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two 
  have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host
  opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is
  given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
  or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous 
  debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when 
  given the option to switch, so this simulation was created
  to test both strategies.
